# Under Attack
It is a game where your guy goes around doing stuff.
Here is what is done in the game:

Movement, dying, coin pickups, chests, fightig, killing and get killed by enemy1, killing enemy2 using enemy1, getting damaged by enemy2, upgrading speed and health regen, Game-Over animation, and a score(not saved), second level with everything the first level has but no enemy1 or enemy2 and lots of zombies

Here is what I want to add in the near future: 

Instruction screen, highscore saving, and pause button.
