# Game 1
This game is currently unnamed.
It is a game where your guy goes around doing stuff.
Here is what you can currrently do:

Move, die, get coins via pickups, chests, and killing enemies, fight, kill and get killed by enemy1, kill enemy2 using enemy1, get damaged by enemy2, upgrade speed, and upgrade health regen.

Here is what I want to add in the near future: 

Instruction and Game-Over screen, implementation of zombie either as separate enemy or ill effects of a current enemy, and pause button.
